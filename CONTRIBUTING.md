## üåø Branching Strategy

We follow **Git Flow** branching strategy:

### Main Branches
- **`main`** - Production-ready code
- **`develop`** - Latest development changes

### Supporting Branches
- **`feature/*`** - New features (branch from `develop`)
- **`release/*`** - Release preparation (branch from `develop`)
- **`hotfix/*`** - Critical fixes (branch from `main`)

### Branch Naming Convention
```
feature/feature-name
bugfix/bug-description
hotfix/critical-fix
release/version-number
```

## üìù Commit Message Guidelines

We use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) specification:

### Format
```
<type>(<scope>): <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```

### Types
- **feat**: A new feature
- **fix**: A bug fix
- **docs**: Documentation only changes
- **style**: Changes that do not affect code meaning
- **refactor**: Code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- **perf**: Performance improvements
- **test**: Adding missing tests
- **chore**: Changes to build process or auxiliary tools

### Examples
```bash
feat(calendar): add one-click event completion
fix(auth): resolve login redirect issue
docs(readme): update installation instructions
style(ui): improve button spacing on dashboard
refactor(api): optimize event query performance
test(calendar): add unit tests for event creation
chore(deps): update Flask to version 2.3.3
```
